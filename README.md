# Frontend (React, Vite)
**To launch:**

cd frontend\
npm install\
npm run dev\


# Backend (Python, Django)
**To launch:**

cd backend\
pip install -r requirements.txt\
python manage.py runserver\

*Before launching, you need to ensure you have Node installed on your computer (for launching frontend) and Python installed on your computer (for launching backend).*

*For the real world application, you wouldn't need to follow these steps, only for testing environment. In the production app, the app will be hosted on both frontend and backend, removing the need for launching on your local machine.*
